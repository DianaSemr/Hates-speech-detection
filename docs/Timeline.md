### Project Timeline (6 Weeks)

---

#### **Week 1**
- Initialize project, create GitHub repository, load dataset, analyze class distribution  
- **Progress**:  
  - **Done**: Project initialization
  - **Done**: Basic EDA (class distribution, text length stats, missing values)    

---

#### **Week 2**
- Deeper analysis, tokenization, lemmatization and embedding preparation (GloVe)  
- **Progress**:  
  - **Not Started**: Deeper EDA  
  - **In progress**: tokenization, lemmatization and embedding preparation (GloVe)

---

#### **Week 3**  
- Train logistic regression 
 

---

#### **Week 4**  
- Build BiLSTM architecture with attention layer; initialize training with GloVe embeddings  


---

#### **Week 5**  
- Fine-tune hyperparameters, evaluate BiLSTM against logistic regression, and interpret attention weights.  

---

#### **Week 6**  
- Results analysis and prepare final report/presentation.
